# MIPS Pipelined Processor

This repository contains the VHDL design of a MIPS pipelined processor.

## Overview

The project showcases an implementation of the MIPS architecture using pipeline processing. By dividing instruction processing into stages, the pipelined design increases throughput and allows for multiple instructions to be processed concurrently.

## Tools Utilized

- **Design Language**: VHDL
- **Simulation Tool**: Modelsim

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have [Modelsim](https://www.mentor.com/company/higher_ed/modelsim-student-edition) installed for simulation.
